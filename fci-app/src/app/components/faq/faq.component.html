                                        to the daily challenges of co-managing these two chronic conditions. In

                                        knowledge of experts at Northwestern University and the University of Miami.
                                        Members of our team have studied a wide range of topics, including the
                                        psychosocial aspects of disease management, health promotion in the LGBT
                                        population, and the use of technology to improve health outcomes. We hope that
                                        sharing our expertise will help you to cope more effectively with cancer and
